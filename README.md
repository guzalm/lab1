problem 8. Given a string “s”, should write the function for checking
whether “s” is all consists of digits. so, it means we need new inputted string
with nums and letters. I add new scanner to get input in main part.
After in isAllDigits() function by using isDigit() method check whether the 
given character is a digit or not and charAt() method which
returns the character at the specified index in a string (!Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i)))
I can check entered string.
