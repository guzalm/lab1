problem 3. Given a number “n”, we should write the function for checking
whether“n” is prime. Here I used conditions which means that "n" could not be less than 2. If there is no problem, function continues working. Then I initialize "divisor=2" to check "n" for prime or composite number. If n divides to 2 without modulus it is prime.
