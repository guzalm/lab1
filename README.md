problem 10. Given “a” and “b”, write the function for finding
GCD(a, b) using recursion. First of all, I created function "gcd". Here I checked is n equal to 0, if yes,
system returns a, or if there is another number system finds their gcd
 by this formula (n, a % n). In main I added variable findGcd which helps to
 call function gcd().
