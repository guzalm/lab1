problem 7. Given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements,
should write the program that returns given array in reverse order
without using array data structure. From problem 1 where we found min from array, we have entered elements to array.
Here we can just reverse that array. Here we work with address of elements in array.
By this arr[n - 1 - i] we can change places of elements.
