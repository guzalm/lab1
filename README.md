problem 5. Given a number “n”, should write the function for finding n-th
elements in Fibonacci sequence using recursion. Was created function fibonacci(). 
By recursion if n is not 1, using formula fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
solves this problem. In main created variable findFib for calling function.
